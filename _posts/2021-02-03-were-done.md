## Well, that's that
I've had this site up for several years now, and I've never really taken to making regular updates.
I'm also working to reduce the number of online things I need to maintain, and that means I'll be taking this website down in the next few weeks.
I'll still keep [my Markdown CV](https://davewhipp.github.io/markdown-cv/) online, and have a [new research group website](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/geodynamics) that will more than suffice for my needs.

In case you want to get in touch, perhaps email (see [research group site](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/geodynamics)) or Twitter ([@dave_whipp](https://twitter.com/dave_whipp)) is easiest.
