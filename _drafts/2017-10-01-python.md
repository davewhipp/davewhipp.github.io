## Geo-Python for the people
One of the things I've been working on this fall is the latest version of the [Introduction to Quantitative Geology course](https://introqg.github.io/) we offer for undergraduate students in their final year.
The course is divided into two parts, with the first half focussing on learning to program using Python, where we meet together with the [Automating GIS Processes course](https://autogis.gitbuh.io/) taught by doctoral student [Henrikki Tenkanen](https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/en/person/hentenka) (with contributions from another doctoral student, [Vuokko Heihinheimo](https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/en/person/vuokkhei)).
Henrikki and I recognized a few years ago that we both needed to devote more of our time to teaching [Python](https://www.python.org/) in our respective courses and the idea emerged that we could meet together in the first part of our courses, then separate for the second half to focus on our topical applications.
Anyway, we're now calling the first part of the course [Geo-Python](https://geo-python.github.io/), and we've put the [entire course online on GitHub](https://github.com/Geo-Python), where you're welcome to clone it and modify as you see fit.
Below, I'll describe a few things we do in the course from the course design perspective, in case they might be of interest to other teachers.

## Course materials
### Open course materials on GitHub
From the start, we wanted to make sure all of our course materials were freely available online, and in a location that would be reliable and easy to find.
In 2016, [the first time we taught the Geo-Python part of the course](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Course-information), we opted to keep the course materials on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com).
GitHub is a natural choice for several reasons, most notably that it is a website used by millions to share and collaborate on software.
There is a growing user base interested in [using GitHub for educational purposes](https://education.github.com/), so that also helps in having some ideas of *how* GitHub can be used for teaching (via the [GitHub Education Community](https://education.github.community/), for instance).

### Using GitHub Pages for course content

### Organizing documentation with Sphinx

### Making assignments with GitHub Classroom

## The student experience
### Course communication with Slack

### Cloud computers

### Screencasts of lectures on YouTube

### Electronic polling using Presemo
